## üìù Mosaic AI Gen AI Apps & Agent Systems

### 1. What are Gen AI Apps?

* Applications that use **generative AI models (LLMs, image models, TTS, etc.)** to create outputs, automate tasks, or engage in conversations.
* Two main architectural patterns:

  * **Type 1: Monolithic LLM + Prompt**

    * Single LLM with well-designed prompts.
    * Best for simple, well-defined tasks.
    * ‚úÖ Simpler, faster, less complex.
    * ‚ùå Limited flexibility, hard to optimize.
  * **Type 2: Agent System** *(recommended)*

    * Multiple interacting components (LLM + retrievers + APIs).
    * Best for complex workflows needing multiple tools and reasoning.
    * ‚úÖ More reliable, flexible, maintainable.
    * ‚ùå Higher complexity, requires orchestration.

### 2. What is an Agent System?

* AI-driven system where **LLM = ‚Äúbrain‚Äù** for reasoning, planning, and deciding.
* Can:

  * Dynamically plan actions.
  * Carry state across steps.
  * Adjust strategy with new info.
* Blends **General Intelligence** (LLM‚Äôs pretrained knowledge) with **Data Intelligence** (enterprise-specific data/APIs).

**Example:**
Customer return request ‚Üí Agent retrieves order info, checks policy, possibly escalates, then triggers return + generates shipping label.

### 3. Levels of Complexity in Gen AI Apps

1. **Standalone LLM (LLM + Prompt)** ‚Äì Simple Q\&A.
2. **Hard-coded Chains** ‚Äì Deterministic steps (e.g., RAG pipeline).
3. **Tool-calling Agents** ‚Äì LLM decides which tool/API to call.
4. **Multi-agent Systems** ‚Äì Specialized agents coordinated to solve tasks.

**Recommendation:** Start simple ‚Üí evolve to more agentic approaches as complexity grows.

### 4. Tools in Agent Systems

* **Retrieval tools** (vector search, structured DB, web search).
* **ML/GenAI tools** (classification, code gen, image gen).
* **API integration tools** (CRM, shipping, Slack/email).
* **Execution tools** (code sandbox, workflow automation).

**Key traits:**

* Perform **one well-defined task**.
* **Stateless** beyond one invocation.

**Safety considerations:**

* Guardrails, timeouts, error handling for failed API calls.
* Prevent infinite loops / repeated failed attempts.

## üîó Role of LangChain & LangGraph

* **LangChain**

  * A **framework for building LLM apps** by chaining together prompts, retrievers, and tools.
  * Provides abstractions for memory, tool usage, retrievers, and orchestrating workflows.
  * Perfect for **hard-coded chains** and **tool-using agents** (Levels 2 & 3).
  * Widely adopted for rapid prototyping of RAG and agent workflows.

* **LangGraph**

  * Built on top of LangChain, designed for **stateful, multi-step, multi-agent systems**.
  * Uses **graph-based execution** where nodes = steps/agents, edges = transitions.
  * Ideal for **multi-agent systems** (Level 4), handling branching, looping, and state persistence.
  * Strong for **production-grade agent orchestration** with reliability and control.

## üß© Impact of Agent Bricks

* **Agent Bricks = Modular, reusable building blocks** for agent systems (retrievers, planners, tools, evaluators).
* They:

  * Simplify **assembly of complex agent workflows**.
  * Allow **plug-and-play reuse** instead of rewriting logic.
  * Improve **maintainability and scalability** for enterprise systems.
  * Work seamlessly with **LangChain & LangGraph**, serving as the standardized ‚ÄúLEGO pieces‚Äù for building apps.

**Impact:**

* In LangChain ‚Üí Bricks replace custom code with reusable components for chains/tools.
* In LangGraph ‚Üí Bricks slot into nodes of the execution graph, enabling **reliable, modular agent orchestration**.

---

‚úÖ **In summary:**

* Mosaic AI supports both **monolithic LLM apps** and **agent systems**.
* For enterprises, **agent systems** are preferred ‚Üí modular, reliable, and scalable.
* **LangChain** = chaining + tool usage (best for simple-to-moderate apps).
* **LangGraph** = orchestration + state (best for complex multi-agent systems).
* **Agent Bricks** accelerate development by making agents modular, reusable, and production-ready.
